# Aftertheapocalypse

WW4 was a disaster for humanity. After the creation of the earth-size nuclear weapon and its utilisation by some unknown government, the few remaining lived in bunkers for more than 42 years.

Many robots were send to explore the radioactive planet and find survivors.

Now is the time to explore this new earth and find what was left for them and maybe the future of humanity.
